This project analyzes employee base salary data from a fictional healthcare company, Acorn Health Systems, to understand how compensation varies by role and department using SQL.

I examined salary data to identify which roles are paid the most within each department and which role shows the greatest pay variability across the organization. The analysis focuses on using SQL aggregations, window functions, and basic statistical measures to surface insights that support compensation benchmarking and pay equity discussions.

## Key Findings
- Engineering Managers have the highest average base salary across all departments
- Manager role compensation varies significantly by department
- Data Engineers exhibit the highest overall pay variance across all roles, with a salary range of $151K
- Data Engineer salaries vary by roughly ±$42K around the average base salary, indicating a wide spread in compensation within a single role

## Recommendations
- Standardize job titles by introducing clearer role tiers (ex. Data Engineer I, II, Senior)
- Review and standardize compensation bands to reduce wide pay variability within roles and mitigate equity risk

## Tools & Skills
Tools: SQL (MySQL)
Skills: Data aggregation, window functions, salary benchmarking, statistical analysis, business insights
